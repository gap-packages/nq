  [33X[0;0YInstallation of the ANU NQ is done in two steps.[133X
  
  
  [1X5.1 [33X[0;0YConfiguring for compilation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFirst the configure script is run:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Installation  [32X[104X
    [4X ./configure  [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you installed the package in another [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X directory than the standard [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  in  your  [5XGAP[105X  4  installation,  then  you have to do two things.
  Firstly during compilation you have to use the option [10X--with-gaproot=PATH[110X of
  the [11Xconfigure[111X script where [21XPATH[121X is a path to the main [5XGAP[105X root directory (if
  not given the default [21X[11X../..[111X[121X is assumed). That is, run[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Installation  [32X[104X
    [4X ./configure --with-gaproot=PATH [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YSecondly  you  have to specify the path to the directory containing your [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  to  [5XGAP[105X's  list  of directories. This can be done by starting [5XGAP[105X
  with  the [21X[11X-l[111X[121X command line option followed by the name of the directory and a
  semicolon.  Then  your  directory  is  prepended  to the list of directories
  searched.  Otherwise the package is not found by [5XGAP[105X. Of course, you can add
  this option to your [5XGAP[105X startup script.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnother  issue  that can occur when running [11Xconfigure[111X is that it may fail to
  locate  the  the  GNU  multiple  precision  library (GMP [GMP]) which ANU NQ
  requires to work. This library is also used by [5XGAP[105X and hence normally should
  be  available  on  your  system anyway. But if this is not the case for some
  reason,  it  has  to  be installed first. A copy of GMP can be obtained from
  [7Xhttps://gmplib.org/[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order  for  the  [11Xconfigure[111X script to find your copy of GMP, you may have
  tell  it  where to find it via [10X--with-gmp=PATH[110X, where [21XPATH[121X is the path where
  GMP was installed:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Installation  [32X[104X
    [4X ./configure --with-gmp=PATH [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf necessary, you may combine [10X--with-gmp[110X and [10X--with-gaproot[110X.[133X
  
  
  [1X5.2 [33X[0;0YCompiling the nq binary[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf [11Xconfigure[111X reports no problems, the next step is to start the compilation:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Installation  [32X[104X
    [4X make [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YA compiled version of the program named [11Xnq[111X is then placed into the directory
  [11Xbin/<complicated   name>[111X.  The  <complicated  name>  component  encodes  the
  operating  system  and  the  compiler used. This allows you to compile NQ on
  several architectures sharing the same files system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  there  are  any  warnings  or  even  fatal  error  messages  during  the
  compilation  process,  please  submit  a bug report about that following the
  instructions in Section [14X5.4[114X[133X
  
  
  [1X5.3 [33X[0;0YTesting[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  the  compilation  is  finished you can check if the ANU NQ is running
  properly on your system. Simply type[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Installation  [32X[104X
    [4X make test [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  runs some computations and compares their output with the output files
  in  the  directory  [11Xexamples[111X.  If any errors are reported, please follow the
  instructions below.[133X
  
  
  [1X5.4 [33X[0;0YFeedback[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  encounter  problems  with  any  of  the  above steps, please do not
  hesitate  to  contact us about this. You can either use the nq issue tracker
  ([7Xhttps://github.com/gap-system/nq/issues[107X)  or  contact the GAP support group
  via  [7Xmailto:support@gap-system.org[107X.  Please make sure to include information
  about  the  specific  issue you encountered (e.g. steps to reproduce it, the
  specific  error  message),  your operating system, the compiler you used and
  also the versions of [5XGAP[105X and this package that were involved.[133X
